first line of a poem by Roman Emperor Hadrian 138 AC
Meaning Little soul, little wanderer, little charmer.

Once a traveler, always a traveler. If it isn't outbound, it's inward. And it isn't about the destination. It's about the road.  Going up and down, left and right. Sometimes welcoming with lots of comfortable hide aways. Challenging at all times. 

I prefer the word Tao. Literary meaning way, path or route. Because it clarifies the point of traveling which is to cross borders, going beyond the clearly visible, the well sign posted and known world and even beyond the world of physical appearances all together. 

Many years ago I set out traveling to expand my geographical map. I end up expanding my mind map. 

I like to share with you the place I call home. As a resting place for you on your travels through life.

23971504,180288270,Ellen,"Hi, 

Nice to virtually meet you and thanks for taking the time to read a little something about me, before or after booking one of my studios!:)

My name is Ellen, I am 46 years old (2021) and I recently renovated my double floor apartment in Amsterdam. This was the biggest (construction) project of my live and I enjoyed every single step of this proces. 

Due to the total renovation I was able to create two fully equipped private studio’s, which I’ve designed with a lot of love and attention. I thought it through over and over again, chose colors, materials and furniture as if I was going to live there myself. And I actually did in the studio on the top floor, while my house on the first floor was totally stripped and build up again. Because I totally stripped both floors and the attic, it was possible for me to change the entrance doors. So the studios are now connected to my private house, but with a private entrance as well as a private bathroom and a private kitchen. Meaning that you don’t have to see me, if you don’t want to!:) You are always welcome to say ‘hello’ and to take a look at my place. 

The entrance to my house is on the first floor and that’s where I live together with my cat ""Pietertje” and my dachshund “Willem”. Those two boys are really giving me a lot of joy, love and fun in my live. They are definitely the best roommates ever!;) I had a fosterchild living with me every other weekend and in the beginning of this year fulltime. She turned 18 last september, so now she is living her life as a ‘free’ young adult. I am still in contact with her and I really hope that I can follow her adult steps because she allows me to. It’s a new way of living together apart and I’m curious how the relationship between the two of us evolves towards the future.  

As a professional I work as a freelance change manager, mainly for Dutch television companies. I really love my job and I always seem to get these perfect matching assignments, which give me positive energy. Off course sometimes I feel the opposite, but fortunately 90% of my professional time spent is vibrant. Since I worked for Dutch television since I was 25 years old,  in many different roles and finally as Director Operations, this is a business which is running through my veins. I like the atmosphere and the content, so I hope to stay in this business as long as I like it. 

Besides these assignments I’m studying at the Dutch Academy for Psychotherapy to become an Integrative Therapist. I’m in my second year now, so already graduated as a certified coach. I’m still figuring out what I’m going to do exactly with this expertise. What will be the form that suits me best? I don’t have the answers yet, but I’m sure it will all come to me as I take it step by step and dare to trust in myself and the future. 

If I’m not working or studying, I like to explore Amsterdam with myself or with friends. There is always something new to discover. There is actually a whole cultural side of Amsterdam which is an unknown area for me and I really want to explore that part of the city. I experienced that my personal interests changes over the years and because of these changes in time, I realize that I can learn and discover more and more about my city every single year. That’s probably one of the fun things of living life!:)

I really hope to welcome you in one of my studio’s and I would be very pleased to make sure you can enjoy a carefree stay in Amsterdam. 

Please do not hesitate and contact me if you have any questions or if you want any personal favorites according to restaurants, bars and other hotspots.

All the best and maybe see you soon!

And in the afternoon we often enjoy a glass of wine on our French balcony on the other side of the apartment, watching many boats come by on the canal. 
Last summer we discovered the Amsterdam canals with our own private boat. Being near the water or on the water is one of the most relaxing things you can do in this city (there’s a boat rental nearby if you would like to try).

46369170,14574533,Hotel Not Hotel,"Hotel Not Hotel Amsterdam is a place where a room isn’t just a room, but a work of art with its own creator, story, and identity. Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

Welcome on my profile page, I am an easy going guy living in downtown Amsterdam. In the middle of it all, yet in in a quiet street. I love to travel and like to meet new people from all over the world! Airbnb is a great community and I am extremely proud they awarded me with the superhost status. I will do the utmost to make you feel comfortable. Besides giving massage I like food, dance, food, theatre, food, coffee, did I say food? ;-)

I have 2 B&B rooms (renovated in February ‘18) I would love to have you as my guest! So if you would like to stay city centre in  a quiet room and have delicious breakfast (included) around the corner, come stay! The B&B is situated in the same building as Massage Studio RUST. (yes I also run a massage center, and yes you get a discount!) In the very heart of Amsterdam. 

Before you book:
I welcome you personally and you will receive my house key. Check in is from 14:00-19:00. Luggage drop off before is possible, please make an appointment. I have a surcharge for check in after 19:00. I cannot accept a 3rd person in the room by Amsterdam city law. A baby counts as a person as well.

2981842,14574533,Hotel Not Hotel,"Hotel Not Hotel Amsterdam is a place where a room isn’t just a room, but a work of art with its own creator, story, and identity. Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

When traveling I prefer to become a local, rather than getting stuck in a tourist trap. 

In daily life I work as a creative strategy consultant for a boutique consultancy in Amsterdam. I'm crazy about animals and hope to have live on a farm one day, until then my little safe haven in Amsterdam North will do.

Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,"['email', 'phone']",Watergraafsmeer,Entire serviced apartment,Entire home/apt,2,1 bath,1,$140.00 ,16,4.63,4.69,4.63,4.44,4.69,4.31,4.19

I spend my time between Amsterdam and Lisbon. If I am in Lisbon , my son Edo looks after the house in Amsterdam and I manage a studio that we rent out on a beautiful cliff overlooking the sea just south of Lisbon. 

In Amsterdam, everybody wanted to live on the canals growing up but today the area has been overtaken by noise and partying people. Our house in Amsterdam South became the place to live with very good restaurants,  great shops, Concerthall and all the Musea around the corner including the convenient Airport Shuttle bus 397 which takes and brings you direct from the airport, only a few minute walk from my house. A lot of my guests take a morning jog in the nearby Vondelpark....

I have lived for twenty years abroad and returned  4years ago.
Before that I have been a stewardess with KLM for fourteen years so I can say receiving people comes natural to me :-) and  it is most important that my quests feel at home.

I hope to welcome you in the near future.....

We really enjoy living in Amsterdam and we are happy to share our favorite spots (bars, restaurants, museums) in Amsterdam and in our neighbourhoud (called de Pijp). Our appartment has a great location (close to the Albert Cuypstraat)! You can easily access the city centre from our home as well as the 'local' neighbourhoods in Amsterdam West and East.

We feel really lucky with our appartment! When we first saw it we immediately fell in love with the light and of course the roof terrace :) We hope you enjoy it as much as we do!

At 44 I started my own Soap business in Januari 2015: De Amsterdamsche Zeepfabriek B.V. The Amsterdam Soap Factory, in Amsterdam. A social firm where we make organic handmade soap bars in Amsterdam, with whoever needs the place to get back to work and to be with others while doing that. Based on 500 years of craftsmanship of soap making as it was big business in Old Amsterdam in 1550.  Soaps & Shampoobars.

Born in Utrecht, in the early seventies, I moved to Amsterdam in '89 to live and study here, and I never left. Except for vacations abroad: California, Australia, London-city and hitchhiking through Europe. Oh, and then New York and Joshua Tree. And Seattle, Austin, Savannah and Santa Monica.. Closer to home I love Vlieland in September, and the Netherlands for camping out. And train and boats to Madrid, BXL, Swiss and Crete..

I was lucky to get a chance to live in this house in the nineties: a small floor just for me with everything I needed. Then two friends came to live with me and we got another floor. And then I got the chance to redo the whole house (2nd, 3rd and 4th floor) with my father Bram and his mate Dion in 2011. The house gets to stay another 100 years!

My house is now the most beautiful loft-house in Amsterdam. A bit hippy. You might want to have a glass with me at the rooftop. I'll think about it ;)

The floor you'll stay on used to be for me and my two bonuschildren: they moved on. I like to use the rooms for guests: come stay, and help me pay off the bank :)",within an hour,100%,70%,"['email', 'phone', 'work_email']",Oud-Oost,Private room in condo,Private room,1,1.5 shared baths,1,$112.00 ,8,5,4.88,4.75,5,5,4.75,4.75

46369237,14574533,Hotel Not Hotel,"Hotel Not Hotel Amsterdam is a place where a room isn’t just a room, but a work of art with its own creator, story, and identity. Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

I came to Amsterdam nine years ago (wow time flies) and immediately fell in love with the city. If you've been here before you'll know why. The beautiful buildings, the canals, the bikes, the word ""lekker"", the easy-going atmosphere, the cafe-style living, the girls (Dutch girls are ""lekker""), the dozen or more independent movie theatres, the summers...

... I guess in the end I just never left!

I work freelance, designing and building websites, and also run an English-language theatre company which I co-founded seven years ago. We perform three shows weekly and run workshops and classes in improvisation and theatre skills.

When I'm not working I'm playing sports. Yoga and kickboxing for fitness, tennis and volleyball for fun and the winter is all about skiing!

Ok! That's probably enough about me, lets talk about you...

I work in the film industrie and had one of the leading casting agencies of the Netherlands for 25 years. During this period  i used to travel a lot, where I  participated in many  feature films and television series abroad. Now I work as a Assistant Director in film and I have my B&B. I love to do both very much.  

I love traveling and also have lived abroad. That is how I found out what I needed of a B&B. A home away from home!


One of the things I  really enjoy about my  B&B is to meet travellers  from all around the world and facilitated them so they  have a great time or moment in Amsterdam.

People who have visited my place have all felt very welcome here. 
Please see the reviews.

 It's  a perfect place to relax after a day's work at the RAI or after a day or night  of visiting the town.

4035170,20921327,Herman,"This was a truly unique experience to stay on a houseboat. I grew up in Amsterdam but never had the opportunity to stay or even visit a houseboat. I stayed here for 10 days at the end of April and was very fortunate to be blessed with great weather. My stay was excellent and the houseboat contributed a large part to that. It is located in one of the best locations of the city: next to the Jordaan and close to the Westermarkt (with Anne Frank house). It is very quiet on the water even though the city is hustling around you. Sitting outside, looking out over the water is a great experience. Weekends the canal is a bit busier with lots of small boats coming through but it create a unique atmosphere that you will not find in any of the hotels. The houseboat itself is unique so it is hard to describe, it is not small, but it does create an intimate atmosphere. I can see it would be great for a romantic stay (even though I stayed alone Lachebekje (zwart-wit)). The layout makes that the sleeping part is separated from the kitchen/living part even though there are no doors between the sections. The bed is excellent, the shower strong and hot, the kitchen fully equipped, lots of books to read and music to play. But most of the time you will be sitting outside enjoying the view of the canal and the sounds of the city. The nights and morning could be a bit chilly but heather worked just fine. I would recommend the houseboat to anyone who would like ta truly unique Amsterdam experience.

What an amazing boat and location! We spent most of our visit sitting on the back deck...and watching the symphony of the city happen around us. The bed was comfy (and I am picky), the fresh flowers were nice. We also enjoyed feeding the momma and daddy ducks with their babies. We will return and we hope the boat is available when we do.

The houseboat was awesome - everything we expected. Fake was a wonderful hosts and the houseboat had everything we needed. We had a small problem with the heat and Fake came over so quickly. It was really a simple button to reset that was all but I hadn't figured it out. The location is fantastic too - really I think best neighborhood in Amsterdam. What a treat to experience Amsterdam this way. I highly recommend it.

El houseboat fue realmente muy confortable , conseguía que te sintieras como en casa y el lugar donde esta situado es simplemente espectacular, cerca de restaurantes, tiendas - se hace hasta un mercado semanal en la zona donde comprar productos de alimentación frescos, bio.....etc Una familia de patos te visita cada día y se mueren por el pan!!!

Es war alles perfekt, die Fotos geben das Boot realistisch wider, Fake war zuverlässig und sehr nett im Kontakt, der Besitzer sehr serviceorientiert und freundlich. Das Bett ist sehr komfortabel, die Ausstattung völlig ausreichend. Die Lage ist wirklich absolut zentral und alles ist fußläufig gut erreichbar. Wir könne die Unterkunft auf jeden Fall weiterempfehlen und werden wiederkommen, wenn das Boot frei ist.

36865545,203731852,Sweets,"SWEETS hotel is a one-of-a-kind hotel located across Amsterdam in 28 different bridge houses. Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,"['email', 'phone']",Centrum-Oost,Private room in serviced apartment,Private room,1,1 private bath,1,$218.00 ,14,4.86,4.79,4.86,4.86,5,5,4.64

We are Nora and Renee. We live in Amsterdam, in one of the nicest and cosiest neighbourhoods. We work as an economist and product owner respectively.  

Renee: I'm a product owner and work in IT. I was not raised in Amsterdam, but moved here after my studies. I've never felt a home like this city and I love that, every time I bike through Amsterdam, I explore new places and hidden gems - Amsterdam is full of it! In my spare time I like to travel. From city trips within Europe to round trips in South Africa or Canada. I love cooking; recently I've been trying to learn Indian curry's with my absolute favorite being the 'Paneer Tikka Masala'. Fun fact: my favorite Indian restaurant in Amsterdam can be found at the Haarlemmerdijk aswell! 

Nora: As well as in my work and my leisure time I love to read and learn about other countries and cultures. In my spare free time I travel to far away places, China being my favorite. Therefore, I’m also trying to learn Chinese. Yet, the pronunciation proves to be very difficult. I’m lucky to live in such a vibrant and historical city as Amsterdam.

46369075,14574533,Hotel Not Hotel,"Hotel Not Hotel Amsterdam is a place where a room isn’t just a room, but a work of art with its own creator, story, and identity. Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

My name is Joris, and I live in the beautiful city center of Amsterdam.

It is a bit a bohemian place, and though the stairs are considered quite steep, once the guests reach the 3th floor they can enjoy a cozy, warm & colorful private room in the 400-yr old house. Ofcourse during the stay of my guests I'll make sure everything will be as comfortable and convenient as possible.

Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

But because of kids coming the ship became too small for 2 kids, so we started to realise an ark, this took about 1,5 year.

27711181,203731852,Sweets,"SWEETS hotel is a one-of-a-kind hotel located across Amsterdam in 28 different bridge houses. Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,"['email', 'phone']",Centrum-Oost,Room in serviced apartment,Hotel room,2,1 private bath,1,$193.00 ,28,4.75,4.79,4.89,4.82,4.89,4.75,4.39

46369286,14574533,Hotel Not Hotel,"Hotel Not Hotel Amsterdam is a place where a room isn’t just a room, but a work of art with its own creator, story, and identity. Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

So we are thankfully raising our two loveliest cats Happy and Tiger. Maincoons. 

I have fallen in love with Asia. Especially Bali, because of it's wonderful nature, the lovely smell of incence, the kind people, humidity and breathtaking sunsets and sunrises. I have visited many nice places and countries but keep thinking and going back to Asia. 

Diners with other families and friends make my life sparkling. Im a peoples-person;). Living concisiously is my way of life, as yoga  is as well. 

An authentic style makes me feel comfi. My style is kind of eclectic, cozy and a little little touch of bohochic. 

My ""mantra"" in life is: 
Feel good, be good & do good...

I spend my time between Amsterdam and Lisbon. If I am in Lisbon , my son Edo looks after the house in Amsterdam and I manage a studio that we rent out on a beautiful cliff overlooking the sea just south of Lisbon. 

In Amsterdam, everybody wanted to live on the canals growing up but today the area has been overtaken by noise and partying people. Our house in Amsterdam South became the place to live with very good restaurants,  great shops, Concerthall and all the Musea around the corner including the convenient Airport Shuttle bus 397 which takes and brings you direct from the airport, only a few minute walk from my house. A lot of my guests take a morning jog in the nearby Vondelpark....

I have lived for twenty years abroad and returned  4years ago.
Before that I have been a stewardess with KLM for fourteen years so I can say receiving people comes natural to me :-) and  it is most important that my quests feel at home.

I hope to welcome you in the near future.....

Actually, I'm called Jacque (short for Jacqueline) 
Although originally I am a New Zealander, I've been living in Europe for over 30 years, and mostly here in this house on Nieuwezijds Voorburgwal - translate that as the New Side of the Front City Wall).  Before Amsterdam it was San Francisco, Barcelona, London and of course Dunedin (New Zealand).  I am a photographer by trade and inclination and also a language trainer (I speak Dutch, English, some Spanish and a little Maori if pushed).  So I can give you some tips for shooting the city and grand spots to go for cafes, restaurants, movies, music, sightseeing, flea markets, and yoga workouts if you've exhausted yourself.
I currently have a small Shuba Inu dog lodging here - very friendly and playful, and luckily she sheds hardly any hair!

Making new memories and sharing a space, experience and recommendations with locals is the best way to explore a city.
Welcome to Amsterdam where we embrace you with kindness but respect your privacy. In case of an emergency you can always reach me.

As a technical allrounder (I can fix nearly everything) is the reason that I was able to renovate this boat myself (with a little help from my friends :-)). The ship is originally build in 1904 and is a so called ""Groninger Bol ship”. Although the ship is more than 100 years old, I modernised it to todays standards with keeping the authentic details.

I hope that you will enjoy your stay with me. And I am happy to inform you about everything Amsterdam has to offer.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,"['email', 'phone']",Westerpark,Entire serviced apartment,Entire home/apt,2,1 bath,1,$189.00 ,57,4.7,4.77,4.88,4.7,4.88,4.79,4.33

41783364,203731852,Sweets,"SWEETS hotel is a one-of-a-kind hotel located across Amsterdam in 28 different bridge houses. Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,"['email', 'phone']",Noord-Oost,Entire serviced apartment,Entire home/apt,2,1 bath,1,$138.00 ,14,4.71,5,5,4.71,4.93,4.14,4.21

Nowadays we are sailing in the Summer with groups of people on board who have a sailing holiday and in the winter we are moored in the beautiful city of Amsterdam. We stay here on one spot. I like to have people on board who enjoy being together.

 I am a woman of the sea and everything that has to do with water has an enormous attraction on me! I love life and take care of myself by eating healthy food, walking in nature with our dog and practice yoga, and sail in the summer of course!

A warm shower and a place to prepare some food helps you to stay on your budget and in summer a little place to sit outside.

I love to meet people and talk about the way we fill in our daily life. Often we see that we have many things in common and yet we are so different.

I have many local tips, if you like to make the most of the free things Amsterdam has plenty to offer but you can also go all out as you can read in my local guidebook here on Airbnb.

We are both creative directors, Hester in Amsterdam and Ibrahim in M'hamid el Ghizlane - Morocco "" the door to the Sahara"".

Hester:

“I love to create wonderful experiences, concepts and brands where people take center stage.  I enjoy to share my international expertise and experience, and co-create social and economic improvement for local communities wherever possible.”

After her study at the Utrecht academy of arts, Hester worked as an international designer in New York, Istanbul and Mumbai. In 2004 she co-founded Butterfly Works, and as its art director was responsible for the development and monitoring of various concepts, products and brands.

In M'hamid Hester and Ibrahim developed the project ""carpet of life"" (Website hidden by Airbnb) a wonderful way to cherish your memories in a handmade carpet by the women in the oasis.

Ibrahim:

Ibrahim is co- founder and creative director of the Taragalte festival and fouder of the bivouac ""Le petit prince"" which is also the location of the festival. Taragalte festival is a yearly festival held in  M'hamid El Ghizlane the ""door of the Sahara"" on the border of Morocco and Algeria.

In Amsterdam it is only allowed to run a B&B when the owner lives in the house as well. So we are also living in the house with our children and our German Sheppard.

Please don't expect silence! At night it is quiet in general after 22h.

Before Amsterdam it was San Francisco, Barcelona, London and of course Dunedin (New Zealand).  I am a photographer by trade and inclination and also a language trainer (I speak Dutch, English, some Spanish and a little Maori if pushed).  So I can give you some tips for shooting the city and grand spots to go for cafes, restaurants, movies, music, sightseeing, flea markets, and yoga workouts if you've exhausted yourself.

What I also really enjoy is that my gardenhouse is a short distance from my house . The rooting with hands in the earth, grow and bloom of flowers and plants I love it.

Since a couple of years we are back in Amsterdam, where we now live with our 2 daughters  (3 & 5 years old).

I (Peter) am working as a GP at my own practice in the city centre of Amsterdam and running my own company Touristdoc: (Website hidden by Airbnb)  Marieke works at a Family Fund that supports social enterprises & foundations within the sustainable food & energy transitions. 

PHILOSOPHY

A dutch saying: ""Wie goed doet, goed ontmoet""

Translated: What goes around, comes around (but only in a positive way)

Interests

Peter: I love to do scuba diving and have a pint afterwards. If there's no diving spots around....just a pint. I'm attracted to most watersports actually. Sailing, surfing and swimming are fun too. Besides that I play field hockey and chess. I' ve been travelling to pretty much everywhere in the world and love to meet new cultures.

Marieke: also loves hobbies ;)

Music, Movies, and Books

I enjoy all kind of movies. Personal best would probably be Godfather 2.

I love electronic dance music like techno and deephouse and dance festivals, but anything with a beat or strong guitars will do.

I think I particularly enjoy world literature.

One Amazing Thing I’ve Done

Too much to mention: 
New York marathon. Diving trips all over the world. The culture shock in India.

Staying with Honduras' most popular pop artist.

Being invited to a family reunion with total strangers in Portugal.

We love travelling

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

45615306,14574533,Hotel Not Hotel,"Hotel Not Hotel Amsterdam is a place where a room isn’t just a room, but a work of art with its own creator, story, and identity. Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

We’ve turned the former lecture hall into an impressive chill-out lounge and bar, while the old library is now a relaxation and private events room. The basement and café are now dining destinations and the original boiler room has become a secret late night bar.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,"['email', 'phone']",Westerpark,Room in serviced apartment,Hotel room,2,1 private bath,1,$167.00 ,77,4.74,4.83,4.88,4.91,4.9,4.66,4.53

2861667,14574533,Hotel Not Hotel,"Hotel Not Hotel Amsterdam is a place where a room isn’t just a room, but a work of art with its own creator, story, and identity. Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,"['email', 'phone']",De Baarsjes - Oud-West,Private room in serviced apartment,Private room,2,1 private bath,1,$173.00 ,32,4.72,4.94,4.88,4.75,4.84,4.66,4.34

At 44 I started my own Soap business in Januari 2015: De Amsterdamsche Zeepfabriek B.V. The Amsterdam Soap Factory, in Amsterdam. A social firm where we make organic handmade soap bars in Amsterdam, with whoever needs the place to get back to work and to be with others while doing that. Based on 500 years of craftsmanship of soap making as it was big business in Old Amsterdam in 1550.  Soaps & Shampoobars.

Born in Utrecht, in the early seventies, I moved to Amsterdam in '89 to live and study here, and I never left. Except for vacations abroad: California, Australia, London-city and hitchhiking through Europe. Oh, and then New York and Joshua Tree. And Seattle, Austin, Savannah and Santa Monica.. Closer to home I love Vlieland in September, and the Netherlands for camping out. And train and boats to Madrid, BXL, Swiss and Crete..

I was lucky to get a chance to live in this house in the nineties: a small floor just for me with everything I needed. Then two friends came to live with me and we got another floor. And then I got the chance to redo the whole house (2nd, 3rd and 4th floor) with my father Bram and his mate Dion in 2011. The house gets to stay another 100 years!

My house is now the most beautiful loft-house in Amsterdam. A bit hippy. You might want to have a glass with me at the rooftop. I'll think about it ;)

1954182,9905351,Erik,"Dear guests,

After living in Amsterdam for 22 years and having become a consultant Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery, my wife Patty and I, together with our 3 young children, moved to a place closer to the sea and nature. As a base, we can still be found regularly in our cozy beach apartment in Noordwijk aan Zee. This apartment is located on the 3rd floor of a 5-floor building and has completely been renovated in 2019.

Because the balcony is quite large, with a sea view, and is conveniently located on the sun (south/west), you can enjoy everything that happens on the beach and in the sea all day long.

Due to the large parking lot at the rear of the apartment complex, you will have no problems finding a parking space and you will eventually only have to cross the boulevard to walk to the beach. There are several beach clubs situated that provide sunbed rental and nice food /drinks, so that you will be completely pampered.

The center of Noordwijk aan Zee with its many shops and restaurants is also about a 10-minute walk from the apartment.

Our main goal is to let you feel comfortable in our apartment and hope you have a wonderfull stay in Noordwijk aan Zee!

With kind regards,

Erik and Patty Salentijn-Roosen

2853285,14574533,Hotel Not Hotel,"Hotel Not Hotel Amsterdam is a place where a room isn’t just a room, but a work of art with its own creator, story, and identity. Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

At 44 I started my own Soap business in Januari 2015: De Amsterdamsche Zeepfabriek B.V. The Amsterdam Soap Factory, in Amsterdam. A social firm where we make organic handmade soap bars in Amsterdam, with whoever needs the place to get back to work and to be with others while doing that. Based on 500 years of craftsmanship of soap making as it was big business in Old Amsterdam in 1550.  Soaps & Shampoobars.

Born in Utrecht, in the early seventies, I moved to Amsterdam in '89 to live and study here, and I never left. Except for vacations abroad: California, Australia, London-city and hitchhiking through Europe. Oh, and then New York and Joshua Tree. And Seattle, Austin, Savannah and Santa Monica.. Closer to home I love Vlieland in September, and the Netherlands for camping out. And train and boats to Madrid, BXL, Swiss and Crete..

I was lucky to get a chance to live in this house in the nineties: a small floor just for me with everything I needed. Then two friends came to live with me and we got another floor. And then I got the chance to redo the whole house (2nd, 3rd and 4th floor) with my father Bram and his mate Dion in 2011. The house gets to stay another 100 years!

My house is now the most beautiful loft-house in Amsterdam. A bit hippy. You might want to have a glass with me at the rooftop. I'll think about it ;)

Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,"['email', 'phone']",De Baarsjes - Oud-West,Room in serviced apartment,Hotel room,2,1 private bath,1,$158.00 ,54,4.93,4.85,4.81,4.94,4.81,4.69,4.61

A social firm where we make organic handmade soap bars in Amsterdam, with whoever needs the place to get back to work and to be with others while doing that. Based on 500 years of craftsmanship of soap making as it was big business in Old Amsterdam in 1550.  Soaps & Shampoobars.

Born in Utrecht, in the early seventies, I moved to Amsterdam in '89 to live and study here, and I never left. Except for vacations abroad: California, Australia, London-city and hitchhiking through Europe. Oh, and then New York and Joshua Tree. And Seattle, Austin, Savannah and Santa Monica.. Closer to home I love Vlieland in September, and the Netherlands for camping out. And train and boats to Madrid, BXL, Swiss and Crete..

I was lucky to get a chance to live in this house in the nineties: a small floor just for me with everything I needed. Then two friends came to live with me and we got another floor. And then I got the chance to redo the whole house (2nd, 3rd and 4th floor) with my father Bram and his mate Dion in 2011. The house gets to stay another 100 years!

My house is now the most beautiful loft-house in Amsterdam. A bit hippy. You might want to have a glass with me at the rooftop. I'll think about it ;)

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,"['email', 'phone']",De Pijp - Rivierenbuurt,Private room in earthen home,Private room,2,1 private bath,1,$198.00 ,38,4.79,4.87,4.89,4.79,4.87,4.71,4.37

27711492,203731852,Sweets,"SWEETS hotel is a one-of-a-kind hotel located across Amsterdam in 28 different bridge houses. Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,"['email', 'phone']",Centrum-West,Private room in earthen home,Private room,2,1 private bath,1,$167.00 ,71,4.82,4.96,4.89,4.79,4.87,4.87,4.58

2981853,14574533,Hotel Not Hotel,"Hotel Not Hotel Amsterdam is a place where a room isn’t just a room, but a work of art with its own creator, story, and identity. Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

There is a lot to do in Amsterdam Noord but if you want to go to the city center, it's just a 10 minutes walk to Central Station. The ferryboat goes every 5 minutes so thats an experience by itself! If you rent a bike you can see a lot of Amsterdam. The typical Amsterdam buildings, canals, streets, the many people by bike, museums, the Dutch people and more!

Hotspots in Amsterdam Noord:
-Pllek
-De Ceuvel
-Tolhuistuin
-Eye Museum

Good restaurants in Amsterdam Noord:
-Pllek 
-Loetje aan het IJ
-Smaaqt
-De goudfazant
-Stork

Al hotspots above are within 5 a 10 minutes by bicycle from our apartment! 

Amsterdam is a busy/load city, so our apartment is the excellent choice if you want to be in the city center within 10 minutes, but also want some peace. There is not a lot noise in the street, you can park your car for free in the front of the apartment and you're in a real Amsterdam neighborhood. 

The apartment is 90 m2 and has two levels. First level has a nice living room, a kitchen with a little balcony were you can eat something. 
Upstairs you'll find the master bedroom with kingsize bed and a nice bathroom with a bath.

My name is Ronel, I am 26 years old and live in my New Studio in Amsterdam. The place was build ( finish ) in July 2015 and is in the most ""cosy"" part of Amsterdam ( West side ).

The West side of Amsterdam is known for a really young and hip area of the city, it is inside the highway ring ( binnen de ring ) as we Dutch call it.

I have a Girlfriend, but we don't live together. When I am not available she will be your contact if there is something wrong. 

Like you I like to travel around the world and Europe, I dive in countries where it is warm because the Dutch really don't like the cold. Good food and good wine addit to my travel and I am a happy person.

When you come to Amsterdam and book a stay in my appartment, you wil find the ""Card for success"" in the Keuken ( keuken is kitchen ). Don't worry, all good tips about nice restaurants and Nightlife are on this, just like some safety procedures you will need to read.

If you book my appartment I will make shure you will feel home in the city, so lets hope we will see you in Amsterdam. 

Don't forget to read the ""Card for success"" and take notice of the safety procedures!

46368959,14574533,Hotel Not Hotel,"Hotel Not Hotel Amsterdam is a place where a room isn’t just a room, but a work of art with its own creator, story, and identity. Most of them designed and specially made by Collaboration-O, a group of young designers that originated from the Eindhoven Design Academy, and one by Arno Coenen and his partner IRIS.

When you wake up, you step into an art-filled, exhibition-like space instead of an anonymous lobby or hallway. The entire hotel is one big living room, with cosy seating areas between the cottages. Combined with our luxury beds and other facilities, Hotel Not Hotel offers an unrivalled experience. 
Besides all this, we feel that the value of a city lies in experiencing its local day-to-day life. As we are closely connected to Amsterdam and its numerous creative entrepreneurs, we know where to send you for a night on the town, a hidden culinary gem, or an upcoming artist’s exhibition. 

The bar connected to Hotel Not Hotel is called Kevin Bacon. Just like the actor, the bar has zero pretention, it always delivers, and it makes sure everybody has a good time.

Kevin Bacon is not your typical hotel bar. It’s where locals get their morning coffee or a quick breakfast. It’s where friends meet for a cocktail or a beer before diving into the nightlife, and where hotel guests let their hair down after a long day in the city.

When the weather is good, the ‘Whitey the White’ terrace is sunny like a perfectly fried egg. The staff’s friendly attitude shines all year round.

We live in the centre of the Netherlands where you are close too city's like Utrecht, Amsterdam and Amersfoort and in the middle of the woods close to lakes and dunes. Hiking, mountenbike and race tracks are very close.

We will most likely be available to welcome you ourselves. I hope the guesthouse is still available for your stay as I am for sure you will have a great time! Let me know if you have any questions!

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,"['email', 'phone']",Centrum-Oost,Private room in earthen home,Private room,2,1 bath,1,$222.00 ,3,4,5,4.67,5,5,5,4.33

Riza is here. I 'd like to welcome you to my place. I myself also a travel lover! People consider me as an open minded and easy going person :) In my spare time I love doing sports and cooking. I am working in the IT field. 

I love to socialize and make new friends around the world.  I see Airbnb as one of the good platforms to do this. I would be happy to inform you about the many touristic, historical & cultural activities in Amsterdam. When it is possible, I could help make your planning during your stay.  Some touristic flyers are also available. 

If I am free, I would not mind to join you for sight-seeing and showing you around. Please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.

love traveling, living in different places and experiencing new cultures... that’s why Amsterdam is the city to be in.
As hobbies, apart from traveling I love diving, cooking (with nice music on), reading  books, do some (amateur) oil painting or just  going for long walks and picnics in Beatrix park (just next to my house) ...
Also like decoration and making my house  nice and cozy.
With friends we often indulge in a grilled meat or fish meal in restaurants nearby accompanied by a cold bottle of white wine. 
For travel or for work, come and try the true Amsterdam life,  I have a bunch of good tips for you :) Have fun!

My house is situated in the picturesque  Rivierenbuurt neighbourhood of Amsterdam city. The neighbourhood is bordered by the river Amstel. 
The neighbourhood features many fine examples of Amsterdam School-architecture. The Dutch word Rivierenbuurt translates as 'Rivers Neighbourhood', refers to the fact that most streets in the area are named after rivers in the Netherlands.

Until World War II the area had a sizable Jewish population which included Anne Frank and her family, who lived at Merwedeplein square until they went into hiding in the secret annex located in the Jordan.

Two minutes walking around my house you can be served by tram routes that takes you everywhere  in the city, such 4 and 12, bus routes 62 and 65, as well as Amsterdam metro and the train from Schiphol Airport, Amstel Station and Zuid Station. But if you want to try the real Amsterdam life you can always rent a bike just next door.

We now live here already quite a while and still Amsterdam gives us both an amazing feeling. In summer we go to a lot of nice music festivals, drink good coffee, go to one of the nice musea or just enjoy what Amsterdam has to offer. 

As experienced travellers me and Vita know how nice it is to visit a place and experience the real city. 

We live in a very nice neighborhood called ""Bos & Lommer"". Just outside of the busy city centre, but very close to all kinds of nice hotspots, parks and 'the famous grachten'.

2. MY AIRBNB HOST HOUSERULES
3. PERSONAL STORY IN DUTCH

PLEASE READ MY HOUSERULES BEFORE YOU MAKE A RESERVATION OF THE 2 ROOMS! YOU ARE VERY WELCOME IF YOU FOLLOW MY HOUSERULES. I LIKE TO SHARE SOME INFORMATION WITH YOU. 
AND IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH MY HOUSERULES, PLEASE, DO NOT MAKE A RESERVATION OF THE 2 ROOMS! THANK YOU.

So first a short story in english:

Hello everybody!
Introducung myself:

People call me extrovert, social and spontaneous. But the interaction with you, will also be influenced by your wishes and needs of course!
As an AIRBNB host I can prepare you tea or coffee with the dutch treat WARM SIRUP WAFELS, when you check in!
Travelling gives me a feeling of overwhelming freedom. I just love to travel around on our world with just 1 backpack. It can be challenging, interesting, exciting, squary, adventurous or horrible! I've been in more then 90 countries and my curiosity becomes bigger after every journey each year.
I also love to collect comic books, have almost 7000.
It means adventure and freedom to me.
When I read them I have the opportunity to travel around in my head.

I live in Amsterdam since 1988. At the moment in the cosey area DE PIJP.
In a beautiful apartment on floor 3 and 4, with a balcony and wonderful roofterrace, on stock 5. 

I have 2 rooms in this apartment which I rent for 3 guests. It is also possible to stay with 4 guests. But be aware: one of the  rooms is quite small for 2 guests. Check in time from 12.00 and check out time at 11.00.
These times are flexible ONLY when I do not have other guests checking in. Sometimes I have to work elsewhere. So let me know which check time you prefer. We have to sort out what the possibilities are. Some guests leave their luggage in my living room, during the check out day. Only possible if I do not need to work or have no outdoor apointments. And pick it up later.
Be aware that I'm living in this apartment, too. We do not need to share toilet and shower on floor 3. Because that is mine. You have YOUR shower and toilet on floor 4. We do need to share the use of the kitchen on floor 3. Although this was never a problem, I experienced after renting out for 3,5 years!
I am not always at home during your stay. Sometimes I need to work or have other apointments. You go your way. I will go mine.

MY HOUSE RULES:

The 2 rooms are available FROM 12.00 mostly. You need to leave the rooms at 11.00, because I need to clean them for the next guests. 

Please do not reserve the 2 rooms if you want 100 % privacy. Because I live in the apartment, too. We need to share the use of the kitchen. Where you can make yourself fresh coffee or tea. Or cook, bake or boil.

And use your own 2 fridges in your 2 rooms, please. Instead of mine.

Also be aware that the 2 rooms are very small! They do not have a lot of space to walk around.
The bathroom is comfortable.

And the 4 stairs are steep and narrow. Do not book these rooms if you have trouble climbing stairs. Not suitable if you come with heavy luggage or a baby! 

Take off your shoes before you enter my apartment. I do not want any shoes anymore in my apartment. To avoid dogshit and street dirt.

No loud noises in my house, corridor  or on the street. There are neighbours living on floor 1 and 2!

Help me to collect plastic and paper in different garbage cans in the kitchen.

Do not smoke in the apartment or in the 2 rooms.
You can smoke on the balcony or roofterrace.

No need to do any dishwashing. Just put your dirty plates or glasses etc in my dishwashing machine in the kitchen.

And enjoy your stay.

Maybe I will meet you when we travel around!
I wish you lots of inspiring journeys!
Maybe we will see each other in the future,
Kind regards, bye, adios, ciao, au revoir!                                                                         Olaf

Hallo reizigers,

Welkom op mijn profiel. Ik woon in de gezellige buurt DE PIJP, vlakbij het mooie Sarphatipark. In deze buurt hoef je je nooit te vervelen. Er zijn enorm veel verschillende soorten cafés en restaurants. De Albert Cuyp markt is elke dag open, behave zondag. Leuke winkeltjes en koffie bars in deze buurt. Voor een mooie film kan je naar Filmhuis Rialto. In het van Ostade theater worden diverse voorstellingen uitgevoerd. Een wandeling langs de Amstel aan de oostzijde is verrukkelijk. Ja, ik ben domweg gelukkig in de pijp.

Ik heb een apartement op etage 3 en 4.
En ik verhuur 2 kleine kamers op etage 4 aan 3 gasten. Dus vrijwel nooit aan 4 gasten. De 2 kamers hebben ook een eigen douche en toilet.
Ik woon zelf ook in het apartement, dus als je de 2 kamers huurt, moet je de keuken en balkon- op etage 3- en dakterras op etage 5, delen met mij. 
Check in: na 12.00 en uitchecken: om 11.00. Deze tijden zijn soms flexibel. Bijv. als er op de uitcheck dag geen andere gasten inchecken voor de 2 kamers.
Misschien tot in de toekomst.

Met warme groeten van Olaf

My name is Tijmen and I’m happy to see you enjoying my apartment and exploring the city where I live since 1992: AMSTERDAM. 

I know Amsterdam and it’s surroundings pretty good and I’m pleased to share my experiences with you. 

My apartment is completely renovated in 2019. It was designed by a Dutch architect specialized in Amsterdam apartments. We created a rather spacious and quite comfortable set-up with some special details like the look-through design fireplace at the center of the house. 

I live here (part-time) together with my two kids. We feel very special to host tourists from around the world. Apart from Dutchies, we already had German, British, French, Italian, Spanish and American guests. We can’t wait to add you on our list. 

Happy to meeting with you!

Cheers,

32905830,203731852,Sweets,"SWEETS hotel is a one-of-a-kind hotel located across Amsterdam in 28 different bridge houses. Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,"['email', 'phone']",Centrum-Oost,Room in serviced apartment,Hotel room,2,1 private bath,1,$900.00 ,2,5,5,5,5,5,5,3

Living my life as a local in Amsterdam for more than three decades I've seen the city change from a big village into a meltingpot of many cultures.
After my kids flew out I decided it was too empty and why not share this beautiful, historical Canalhouse with people from all over the world?
When I was traveling it was so much nicer to stay at an Air BNB than between the cold white walls of a hotel.
Locals offered me a peek in their daily life and added so much more to my trips.
We love dogs, colorful (street) art, rock/ pop music, Harley's, photography, a good book and meeting people from all over the world. We will do our very best to give you a great bnb experience  and provide you with personal recommendations and tips.
Our favorite cities are NYC, Lisbon, Barcelona, Prague, Venice, Copenhagen and Amsterdam.

Our motto is: Don't judge a book by it's cover :)

My personal interests are art, photography, film and design, and I love to show my guests the local hotspots. New shows and exhibitions, exciting places to go for shopping, coffee or food, I am happy to share if you want to know.

Feel free to be my guest if you are familiar with game or talk with the guests. We are all kind people.

When I work in the apartment it's always nights from 22:00 till 05:00 AM. I use that time to also clean the apartment and make it convenient for the guests when they wake up it's clean and there is enough space for them to use everything they need.

In my humble opinion I am very privileged to live in one of the most special places in the world: Durgerdam (Amsterdam - North).  On a historical dyke (former fisherman village), next to the IJsselmeer lake, in the typical Dutch rural landscape, but still very close to the unique city of Amsterdam.

As television producer I did (and do)  travel  a lot and I am always a fan of remarkable, unique accommodations to sleep and to stay in. Especially  excited do I get  when they are placed in the middle of nature or at unique locations.  Inspired by my visits to those spots, I decided to build my own little house, with all the comfort you need on a special place; my hometown Durgerdam/Amsterdam North.

Together with an architect we created the Tiny House. An authentic small wouden house, where I hope a lot of other people feel at home and can enjoy the green area & of course Amsterdam..

Onze missie is om van ons schip een voorbeeld te maken in de zeilchartervaart op het gebied van duurzaamheid.

Whether you are visiting Amsterdam for the first time or you have visited it before, you will always
find something new in this city full of history. Let us introduce you to this magnificent place in
another way!

We are Maria and Aurora. We met years ago in this same amazing and fabulous city, a city where
dreams come true. Here's something about us too:
I am Maria and I am an aspiring illustrator and I am also a mother. I have a Master Degree in plastic arts , fine arts and art history. After spending time abroad, I decided to stay and live in Holland. Apart from my love for art, I have always dreamed of having a small hotel where I can meet interesting people. What could be better than to be in such a fabulous and artistic city as Amsterdam! I have been away from this wonderful city and country for a short time. But it didn't take long before I came back to Amsterdam to rediscover it. Anyone who has been to Amsterdam one time, always comes back!

I am Aurora and I am a fashion branding manager and PR expert. Fashion is my passion. I have more than 15 years experience in the fashion retail industry and B2B events. I have developed several PR activities for fashion showrooms, international designers, brands, individual press shows and shows for fashion platforms. In addition to my professional love for fashion, I, as a mother, love home comfort and want to pass this love on to you and make you feel at home.

As for my interests, the thing I love the most, is to travel! My favourite countries are Nicaragua and Colombia, but since visiting Indonesia in April, I am very fond of that country as well. Furthermore, I like indoor climbing and surfing, which is hard, living in the Netherlands.

Most weekends, I am out and about town. Visiting festivals with friends, our going for dinner in a nice restaurant! I love to dance, and henceforth, I do that a lot. But I also love waking up at Saturday morning, drinking a coffee to go from my favourite coffee bar and stroll around the Dappermarkt, the local market here. I can spend hours finding the fresh ingredients needed to prepare Vietnamese springrolls. 

The neighbourhood has a lot to offer, from cute bars, nice shops and fancy restaurants. If you want to take shopping to the next level, the city centre is only 10 minutes away. That being said, there is a lot to see and do in Amsterdam East. For example, drink a delicious cocktail at Walters Woodbury Bar, having a local beer at Brouwerij het IJ or taking a stroll trough the city parks.

The neighbourhood is a cool place to be. Very near to the city enter but not as much overwhelmed with tourists. Nice shops, good restaurants, good bakeries and a very good mix of nice Amsterdamers.

After having lived in various places around the globe - from Buenos Aires to Sao Paulo, Brussels to Milan, last summer, we moved into our first family home in Amsterdam, one of our world’s most historical, vibrant and liberal cities. 

As a true Dutch, Rosa loves flowers, interior design and her bike. She works at Airbnb since 2019. If not at work, you will find her cycling around, learning new languages (next stop: Italian!) or dancing with friends. Andreas loves sports (Italian football in particular) and sailing, preferably through the canals of his home town Venice.  

Thanks to our diverse nationalities (Dutch, Italian, Greek) we are passionate connecting with people from different backgrounds, cultures and nationalities. We love hosting our family and friends with Mediterranean food and world music at home.  

We hope to welcome you at our lovely home soon!

Arthur will welcome our guests and can tell you much about the neighborhood. Why are we host? Because we really like to meet new people. But also it's nice to show our beautiful city.
 
We have two daughters. One of 16 years and the other is 11 years. We have a dog Rakker, where we enjoy hiking. 

I was born and raised in Amsterdam and also know a lot about this beautiful city to tell.  We like sports, tennis, horse-riding and our daughters play hockey. We love running, swimming and skiing.

I speak Papiamento (creole language spoken in the Dutch Caribbean), English, Dutch and Spanish. Next to this I understand French and Portuguese.

I love to travel and have been able to visit many countries in Latin America, North America, Europe, and Asia. Travelling has given me a better understating of various cultures. On my journeys I have been able to meet great people and love  and our differences. Having guests over allows me to travel to their necks of the world. This is one of the reasons, I love to run this floating B&B. I get the chance to share the love that was shared with me on my journeys.

2985952,1448980,Laila,"My name is Laila,

Born and raised in Amsterdam,  traveling the States for work for the last couple of years.

This lovely low- maintenance city is a metropole within a village; it combines the thrill and diversity of serious metropoles with the cosy and safe qualities of a village. It's the kind of city of love and it's the kind of person I am; I love the thrill and the quiet. 

I am a free lance journalist, podcaster and writer with a fascination for the human ability to adapt to the challenges of life and the the biggest challenge of all: living together, making democracy work.   Both fascinations are ever-present in the USA, so that'w where I find my stories.  

Furthermore I love cinema, basketball, cooking, dining, wine, springtime and long walks. With the ones I love, of course. In 2016, I started surfing and have taken every chance ever since to catch waves.  

I started booking with airbnb in 2011  and knowing the joy of staying in a great and homy place  decided to be part of the sharing economy all the way and share my place and knowledge of this city with like minded travelers around the world in 2014. I really do believe the sharing experience adds to the any stay, anywhere. My home is not a holiday rental - I care to share it with travelers who enjoy the sharing and local kind of travel and treat a home that same way.

I am a freelance writer. When I am not writing, I teach and do research at the university. When I'm not writing or working at the university, I am probably lost somewhere in one of my new journeys. My way of traveling is to get in touch with the authentic life as much as I possibly can, so I often stay with local families, in local houses, and shun the hotels all together. 

From all my journeys, the country where I would want to come back for food is Peru, for culture is India, for nature is New Zealand, for people is Yemen, and for a deep touch of love, I go to Vietnam. My dream is to be able to visit Saudi Arabia because it is the only place that does not welcome normal tourists. However, the two places where I seem to have everything right now are Sydney, and of course Amsterdam. It is a greedy combination I know.

Thanks for taking the interest and time to read this :)

I am an engineer turned start-up advisor/entrepreneur who loves living in the coolest area of Amsterdam as much as I love traveling the globe, meeting amazing people and learning about cultures and languages!

I was born on the island of Cyprus, and lived on its gorgeous unspoilt Northern shores until 17. Then I moved around to study in the US, Istanbul and London before moving here a long time ago. Since then I've become a proud Amsterdammer! 

When I travel I prefer to have authentic experiences instead of being a mainstream tourist. If you are one of us who wants to live the real deal instead of following the flocks of tourists, then you have found your host! 
I try to befriend locals, learn and experience as much about the local history, language, culture and customs and try to be respectful and humble. I contribute if I can. When possible I give my money to the services of local hotels and businesses I want to support and to legit non-profits like a children's hospital or an animal shelter. 


In my free time I enjoy exploring the hidden history, architecture, world cuisine, art & design and nightlife of this great city.

My hobbies are good food in good company(I'm crazy about both cooking and dining out), going to musea, galleries & festivals, growing plants, ethics, photography, music & vinyl, history, activism, contemporary culture, travel, yoga and brewing beer. 

I am fascinated by our living planet and feel passionate about sustainability methods and practices whether it is my own life style choices, smart cities, permaculture, energy, technology, tourism, peace or ethical new world business models. 

I wish for a better world, not just for some but for all, and I know we have a tribe, people like you and me are out there :) I've seen that we can create our own reality together when we focus on a common goal together as a community and really connect, either physically or virtually through the web. (I can't help but chuckle now as I type this on airbnb!)

My guests would describe me as warm & friendly, hospitable, helpful, flexible and fun. I have probably thought of most things you might need during your stay!

As an insider I will give you tips on whatever you fancy - from where to indulge in the tastiest burger, local cuisine & delicacies, a Michelin starred dinner, or rooftop view cocktails, to what you shouldn't miss in town day and night... And more. 

I look forward to our paths crossing and welcoming you to Amsterdam!

With much love and best wishes,

Na het huren van een eerste appartementje midden op de Wallen (Amsterdam Centrum) en de stad verder leren verkennen, vond ik ruim een jaar later ons huidige appartement in Amsterdam Oud-West. Een van de meest populaire buurten onder de Amsterdammers. Met veel plezier heb ik met andere studenten, waaronder vriendinnen, hier gewoond. Sinds 2019 woon ik samen met mijn vriend.
Sfeer, gezelligheid en warme kleuren voeren de boventoon in ons ruime appartement. Het interieur wisselend uit ikea, new design en vintage treasures zijn met veel liefde uitgezocht. De ruime eet- en woonkamer geeft je, na een lange dag door de Amsterdamse straten, het gevoel van thuiskomen. De identieke slaapkamers geven een ultiem gevoel van hotelkwaliteit. De badkamer is voorzien van toiletartikelen en uitgerust met een douche en ligbad. Samen met de luchtzuiverende planten kunt u helemaal tot rust komen. 
Voor de thuischef is de keuken van alle gemakken voorzien. Vanwege de middag- en avondzon kunt u zowel voor als achter op het ruime balkon dineren. 
Bedankt dat u de tijd heeft genomen om ons beter te leren kennen en wij hopen u snel te mogen ontvangen. U bent meer dan van harte welkom!

I share my house with two very sweet roommates, my cats Tijger and Sesam.   Unlike myself, they don't like traveling at all and therefore they always stay at home while I'm away. They don't need much taking care of, just fresh food and water each day. Once they're used to you, they will most probably ask for attention now and then, but they mostly keep to themselves :-) 

Let me know if you have any questions!

Great that you are having a look at my personal profile. 

In short something about myself; I work and live in Amsterdam since 2009. During work days I have to go right through the city center on my bike to get from “de Pijp”  (the area I live) to the office next to Central Station. It entertains me to see all the people with their own goals, planning of the day and personal expressions. In Amsterdam you never get bored with all the entertainment / shopping area’s, musea, and great terraces with the canal sceneries on the background.

In addition, the city allows me to variate on the restaurants I like to go to, to meet up with friends and relax in its surrounding nature.  As I like to exercise 3 to 4 times a week it is great  to have the Sarphati park next door and greater green areas just outside the city center. 

Conclusion, I thoroughly enjoy living in Amsterdam and would highly recommend it for both business and/ or pleasure.

28298830,203731852,Sweets,"SWEETS hotel is a one-of-a-kind hotel located across Amsterdam in 28 different bridge houses. Each bridge house has been transformed into an independent hotel suite that accommodates a maximum of two guests.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,"['email', 'phone']",Oud-Noord,Entire serviced apartment,Entire home/apt,2,1 bath,1,$158.00 ,80,4.66,4.76,4.76,4.73,4.93,4.63,4.35

I love music everything to do with music. Events, concerts, cycling, spending quality time with my 2 daughters and always looking forward to welcome the next guest. Every guest is unique and that makes airbnb exciting and fun.  The keyword is just feel free as if you were in your own house.
The room is for my 2 daughters.  I sometimes rent it out when they are away.
Looking forward to welcome you to Amsterdam.  The place to be.

In my house I offer two double bed & coffee rooms each with a private shower and one room even with a bath. I live in the building and I have my own bathroom. A bed & coffee room means your rent a b&b room, but instead of breakfast with unlimited coffee and tea that you make with your own Nespresso maker. The building offers a pretty unique large roof terrace that is magically lit by night. 

I'm a foody and spend much of my time cooking, going to the local markets and enjoy restaurants. If you need some advise where to go or what to eat please ask!

In my home I offer my guests privacy. But please knock my door for questions or a chat any time and most likely we’ll meet on the terrace anyway ;)

Enjoying a city like Amsterdam is all about having a place where you feel comfortable and safe at home in a strange environment. And especially to have a good bed, a warm shower and a nice cup of coffee or tea with a stroopwafel at any time you like. In my travels I visit and visited a lot of B&B's globally. Staying in a room in somebody’s home often felt I was staying with friends. Some of them became and still are dear friends after many years. This experience is what I try to offer my guests. Live like a local, feel at home. Tot ziens in Amsterdam, Marcel.

B&B Lisenced by council of Amsterdam.

I am Guiseppe and I love to host the stay of Airbnb travelers!  I am an experienced host which loves to take good care of his guests.

I am really familiar in Amsterdam so I can be a great guide for directions, cool places to stay to make sure you will have a great time.

I am an entrepreneur working on a Card Game with real Girls for IOS and Android. In the living room I have my studio which doesn't make loud noise. From the living room I stream the progress of my game on the Internet. Sometimes with kind quests who know I run an AirBNBN.  Feel free to be my guest if you are familiar with game or talk with the guests. We are all kind people.

When I work in the apartment it's always nights from 22:00 till 05:00 AM. I use that time to also clean the apartment and make it convenient for the guests when they wake up it's clean and there is enough space for them to use everything they need.

Looking forward hosting your stay!

23971759,180288270,Ellen,"Hi, 

Nice to virtually meet you and thanks for taking the time to read a little something about me, before or after booking one of my studios!:)

My name is Ellen, I am 46 years old (2021) and I recently renovated my double floor apartment in Amsterdam. This was the biggest (construction) project of my live and I enjoyed every single step of this proces. 

Due to the total renovation I was able to create two fully equipped private studio’s, which I’ve designed with a lot of love and attention. I thought it through over and over again, chose colors, materials and furniture as if I was going to live there myself. And I actually did in the studio on the top floor, while my house on the first floor was totally stripped and build up again. Because I totally stripped both floors and the attic, it was possible for me to change the entrance doors. So the studios are now connected to my private house, but with a private entrance as well as a private bathroom and a private kitchen. Meaning that you don’t have to see me, if you don’t want to!:) You are always welcome to say ‘hello’ and to take a look at my place. 

The entrance to my house is on the first floor and that’s where I live together with my cat ""Pietertje” and my dachshund “Willem”. Those two boys are really giving me a lot of joy, love and fun in my live. They are definitely the best roommates ever!;) I had a fosterchild living with me every other weekend and in the beginning of this year fulltime. She turned 18 last september, so now she is living her life as a ‘free’ young adult. I am still in contact with her and I really hope that I can follow her adult steps because she allows me to. It’s a new way of living together apart and I’m curious how the relationship between the two of us evolves towards the future.  

As a professional I work as a freelance change manager, mainly for Dutch television companies. I really love my job and I always seem to get these perfect matching assignments, which give me positive energy. Off course sometimes I feel the opposite, but fortunately 90% of my professional time spent is vibrant. Since I worked for Dutch television since I was 25 years old,  in many different roles and finally as Director Operations, this is a business which is running through my veins. I like the atmosphere and the content, so I hope to stay in this business as long as I like it. 

Besides these assignments I’m studying at the Dutch Academy for Psychotherapy to become an Integrative Therapist. I’m in my second year now, so already graduated as a certified coach. I’m still figuring out what I’m going to do exactly with this expertise. What will be the form that suits me best? I don’t have the answers yet, but I’m sure it will all come to me as I take it step by step and dare to trust in myself and the future. 

If I’m not working or studying, I like to explore Amsterdam with myself or with friends. There is always something new to discover. There is actually a whole cultural side of Amsterdam which is an unknown area for me and I really want to explore that part of the city. I experienced that my personal interests changes over the years and because of these changes in time, I realize that I can learn and discover more and more about my city every single year. That’s probably one of the fun things of living life!:)

I really hope to welcome you in one of my studio’s and I would be very pleased to make sure you can enjoy a carefree stay in Amsterdam. 

Please do not hesitate and contact me if you have any questions or if you want any personal favorites according to restaurants, bars and other hotspots.

All the best and maybe see you soon!

find something new in this city full of history. Let us introduce you to this magnificent place in
another way!

We are Maria and Aurora. We met years ago in this same amazing and fabulous city, a city where
dreams come true. Here's something about us too:
I am Maria and I am an aspiring illustrator and I am also a mother. I have a Master Degree in plastic arts , fine arts and art history. After spending time abroad, I decided to stay and live in Holland. Apart from my love for art, I have always dreamed of having a small hotel where I can meet interesting people. What could be better than to be in such a fabulous and artistic city as Amsterdam! I have been away from this wonderful city and country for a short time. But it didn't take long before I came back to Amsterdam to rediscover it. Anyone who has been to Amsterdam one time, always comes back!

I am Aurora and I am a fashion branding manager and PR expert. Fashion is my passion. I have more than 15 years experience in the fashion retail industry and B2B events. I have developed several PR activities for fashion showrooms, international designers, brands, individual press shows and shows for fashion platforms. In addition to my professional love for fashion, I, as a mother, love home comfort and want to pass this love on to you and make you feel at home.

BUT 99% of our stay at home we feel like we are on holiday! For example when:
- we shower in bright sunlight or underneath the stars! 
- we feed the swans from our own dining table
- we enjoy our privacy with no one being able to watch you
- we are treated with the brightest sunrise or a colorful sunset!
- we snuggle into our very very comfortable extra large box spring 
- when we jump into the water from our own boat!
- shall I go on? :)

Please share our love for water & respect our way of living: being humble and respectful towards nature and the people around you. And we welcome you to our HIDDEN GEM in Amsterdam! 

Any questions? We are happy to answer you! 

See you soon?

I still visit Amsterdam often as all of my family is there and I love them dearly. 
However.. Whenever I'm not around I gladly open my home up to travelers. 
Same goes for New York actually :)

I love to cook, good food, wine, COFFEE
And everything that involves film, art, nature, fashion and history.

My favorite book is Shantaram.
My favorite movie; too many to name
I religiously go to the cinema every sunday.
(not to mention all the inflight movies)

Music; I could not live in a world without music.
And I enjoy opera and ballet very much. 
Unfortunately I do not go too often.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,"['email', 'phone']",Zuid,Private room in serviced apartment,Private room,2,1 private bath,1,$158.00 ,59,4.8,4.85,4.88,4.85,4.9,4.75,4.54

My name is Ronel, I am 26 years old and live in my New Studio in Amsterdam. The place was build ( finish ) in July 2015 and is in the most ""cosy"" part of Amsterdam ( West side ).

The West side of Amsterdam is known for a really young and hip area of the city, it is inside the highway ring ( binnen de ring ) as we Dutch call it.

I have a Girlfriend, but we don't live together. When I am not available she will be your contact if there is something wrong. 

Like you I like to travel around the world and Europe, I dive in countries where it is warm because the Dutch really don't like the cold. Good food and good wine addit to my travel and I am a happy person.

When you come to Amsterdam and book a stay in my appartment, you wil find the ""Card for success"" in the Keuken ( keuken is kitchen ). Don't worry, all good tips about nice restaurants and Nightlife are on this, just like some safety procedures you will need to read.

If you book my appartment I will make shure you will feel home in the city, so lets hope we will see you in Amsterdam. 

Don't forget to read the ""Card for success"" and take notice of the safety procedures!

Enjoy your stay

Whether you are visiting Amsterdam for the first time or you have visited it before, you will always
find something new in this city full of history. Let us introduce you to this magnificent place in
another way!

We are Maria and Aurora. We met years ago in this same amazing and fabulous city, a city where
dreams come true. Here's something about us too:
I am Maria and I am an aspiring illustrator and I am also a mother. I have a Master Degree in plastic arts , fine arts and art history. After spending time abroad, I decided to stay and live in Holland. Apart from my love for art, I have always dreamed of having a small hotel where I can meet interesting people. What could be better than to be in such a fabulous and artistic city as Amsterdam! I have been away from this wonderful city and country for a short time. But it didn't take long before I came back to Amsterdam to rediscover it. Anyone who has been to Amsterdam one time, always comes back!

I am Aurora and I am a fashion branding manager and PR expert. Fashion is my passion. I have more than 15 years experience in the fashion retail industry and B2B events.

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,"['email', 'phone']",Oud-Noord,Private room in serviced apartment,Private room,2,1 private bath,1,$158.00 ,43,4.88,4.88,4.95,4.7,4.91,4.7,4.51

I moved to Amsterdam 16 years ago and after a few years decided to make it my home. I enjoy sharing my passion for this city with my guests and fellow travellers. 

Amsterdam feels like home now and I really miss my bike whenever I stay away too long. Sometimes, when cycling back through the canals in the evening, I still stop in awe at a canal bridge taking in the view. 

I have a curious mind and like to explore and learn new things, be it by traveling, talking to people, watching documentaries or reading. I travel as far as I can and as often as I can. So far I visited 57 countries and I keep counting... 

I really enjoy being a host and each time do my utmost best to make my guests' stay a nice experience. It feels like making new friends and I'm really happy when they come back to Amsterdam.

We have a quay, next to the ship, where you can relax in the sun, till late in the evening. We also have a fire pit at the quay, so you can extend those lovely nights....

We have a big kitchen, with dishwasher, microwave, freezer, etc.
The livingroom is big as well, we have a television, wifi, WII and a wood stove.
In the front of the ship is one (large) bedroom with a bed for two persons and in the back of the ship is also a bed for two persons, a little bit bigger than the other bed.
We have a bathroom with a bathtub and shower.
Washing machine is also available on the ship.
We have two cats. They are both lovely and will stay on the ship.

We have a natural fence of plants around the water, so it is quite safe for little kids. But we also have life vests for the little ones, which is advised.

The ship is docked and not able to sail anymore, so you don't have to be afraid of waking up in the middle of the canal ;)

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,"['email', 'phone']",IJburg - Zeeburgereiland,Private room in earthen home,Private room,2,1 private bath,1,$181.00 ,8,4.88,5,5,5,5,4.88,4.88

The original hiding place is still preserved and the various floors and spaces represent the houses vibrant history since the 1940s.

Three friends, Michael, Frans and Lars run H401 today. The building contains partly a time capsule going back to the forties / fifties / sixties and combines it with contemporary spaces.  In this typical Amsterdam canal house, we offer two independent guest appartments, both recently restored in a minimalist manner, with a stunning view to the canal in the front  facing a row of historic 17th century gables and the monumental Krijtberg Church in the back. The rooms offer the unique experience of a historic place with contemprary comfort (state of the art beds, linen, towels etc) The apartments offer fully equipped kitchens  with dishwasher, microwave/ oven etc. Though the house is situated at a quiete part of the famous 'gouden bocht' of the Herengracht, the famous lively and fashionable nine streets are literraly around the corner; they offer stylish cafes, bars, shops, lunch and diner possibilities.

We love to travel so we are away a lot from home and want to let others enjoy our home. 

We like to watch good movies & series so we have a big 3D 55inch flatscreen  with netflix on it and a very comfi couch with loveseat to enjoy this screentime and makes it almost better as watching it in the cinema!

I have a big passion for cooking and as you see we have a open kitchen where there is everything you need, one big oven and a small oven, 6 pitt gaspit and a cookisland to prepare your 3 course menu or to bake pies & cupcakes what Suzanne likes to do. When the weather is good we can go up to the rooftopterrace and chill on the loungeset and make some burgers on the BBQ and enjoy the endless sun and nice view over Amsterdam.

We are both big music lovers and I also play the drums and have an electronic drum in the livingroom, feel free to play some tunes but keep the headset on for the neighbours.

We are very easy going people who like festivals, concerts, movie & theater a lot. Our house is in the weekends filled with friends and/or family to have nice dinners and chilltime. Our neighbourhood is very beautifull and quiet, around the corner there is the smallest canal of Amsterdam, a beautifull old mill and also a big playground for children next to the water. The street next behind ours you'll find a small shoppingstreet with big supermarket, several (take-away) restaurants, lunch & coffeeplaces, 2 drugstores, officesupplie store, flowershop and nightshops. 
We live close to hotspots where the Amsterdam-people go to such as The Marktkantine, The Foodhallen and Westerpark. We go there a lot because all three full of good food & drinks, music, party even movies and other cultural events!
We live very happy & peacefull in our house, if you rent it you will feel the good energy and the big amount of sunshine through the whole house. We do expect that if you stay here you take good care of our home while were not there. So if you want to party do it outside of the house, you're in Amsterdam enough pleaces to go to! 

We will leave a small guide, where you find everything in our neighbourhood and the public transport. We hope you will enjoy our house and Amsterdam to the fullest!

I am a entrepeneur and boat lover.

For us, the houseboat is one big adventure! We jumped into it and we are 99% finished on how we would like to have it. However, as some of you boat lovers will know, a boat is never finished! You will always need to upgrade something or when you are less fortunate, repair something. 

BUT 99% of our stay at home we feel like we are on holiday! For example when:
- we shower in bright sunlight or underneath the stars! 
- we feed the swans from our own dining table
- we enjoy our privacy with no one being able to watch you
- we are treated with the brightest sunrise or a colorful sunset!
- we snuggle into our very very comfortable extra large box spring 
- when we jump into the water from our own boat!
- shall I go on? :)

Please share our love for water & respect our way of living: being humble and respectful towards nature and the people around you. And we welcome you to our HIDDEN GEM in Amsterdam!

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,"['email', 'phone']",Oud-Noord,Private room in serviced apartment,Private room,2,1 private bath,1,$154.00 ,41,4.63,4.73,4.73,4.68,4.61,4.61,4.44

For centuries, Amsterdam’s bridge houses accommodated the city’s many bridge keepers who were responsible for opening the impressive structures for passing water traffic. With building dates between 1673 and 2009, the bridge houses carry an extensive history. Visiting them in chronological order is like a journey through time: their various architectural styles reveal how the city developed and grew, when new quarters were built and even how people thought about city development at that time.

With the hotel room interiors, SWEETS hotel offers guests a unique and comfortable living space, while keeping the history of every bridge house in mind. All bridge houses are different, and so are the interiors. Every SWEET accommodates up to two adults and contains a kingsize double bed, a bathroom and coffee and tea facilities.

SWEETS hotel, first initiated in 2012 as an urban space project, is 8 years in the making. Over half of the 28 bridge houses are currently available for reservations, with more coming soon.

SWEETS hotel is an initiative and co-creation of the architecture office Space&Matter (known for De Ceuvel, an ecological hub), project development partner Grayfield and Suzanne Oxenaar and Otto Nan of Seven New Things, founders of Lloyd Hotel & Cultural Embassy (the world’s first 1- to 5-star hotel) and Hotel The Exchange.",within an hour,100%,99%,"['email', 'phone']",Zuid,Private room in serviced apartment,Private room,2,1 private bath,1,$146.00 ,78,4.81,4.82,4.88,4.72,4.87,4.85,4.45

We love AIrbnb. It is a great concept. We are proud te be a member of this community and love to explore the world at other Airbnb nice places. We introduce ourselves.
We arrived in Amsterdam in 1992 ( Michiel) and 1994 (Marlous) for doing our study and since then we didn’t leave this amazing city (except all the travels and work experiences abroad) so we discovered the city at early age ( with experiencing all the good and bad things), started our career over here and now we have our family life in this lovely neighborhood which feels like a modern upgraded ghetto in the middle of the energetic city of Amsterdam.

We enjoy our family life with the kids who goes to school and has there friends nearby and playgrounds are all over around (our garden, “Vondelpark”, “Museumplein”) and within a second we leave the house for a movie (at Cinecenter Cinema near ""Leidseplein"" is our favorite) or a theatre (Stadsschouwburg at ""Leidseplein"" which also has lots of International Plays) or having drinks with friends in one of the bars or restaurant nearby (the “Pijp” or the Jordaan”).

In 2010 I have traveled through South America as a backpacker together with my sister for about 10 months and fell in love with the continent, especially with Argentina and Buenos Aires. I have been going back yearly and recently lived there for a couple of years as well. 
In 2016-2017 my sister and I lived and traveled in New Zealand with a working holiday visa, so that was another great adventure where we used Airbnb regularly :)

I like to join this platform both as a host and a guest. When possible, I offer my apartment in Amsterdam to fellow travelers during my own holidays.

In my profile I said I speak Spanish, because I do understand most of it. I'm far from fluent though, especially my speech isn't good!

In case I’m abroad either my mother Regien or sister Belle will be your host and handle both the check-in and check-out. In that case their contact information will be available to you after booking.

Portugal, Czech Republic, France, Norway, Turkey, America, Aruba, Lebanon, Syria, South-Africa. These are some of the countries we have visited.

In my house I offer two double bed & coffee rooms each with a private shower and one room even with a bath. I live in the building and I have my own bathroom. A bed & coffee room means your rent a b&b room, but instead of breakfast with unlimited coffee and tea that you make with your own Nespresso maker. The building offers a pretty unique large roof terrace that is magically lit by night. 

I'm a foody and spend much of my time cooking, going to the local markets and enjoy restaurants. If you need some advise where to go or what to eat please ask!

In my home I offer my guests privacy. But please knock my door for questions or a chat any time and most likely we’ll meet on the terrace anyway ;)

Enjoying a city like Amsterdam is all about having a place where you feel comfortable and safe at home in a strange environment. And especially to have a good bed, a warm shower and a nice cup of coffee or tea with a stroopwafel at any time you like. In my travels I visit and visited a lot of B&B's globally. Staying in a room in somebody’s home often felt I was staying with friends. Some of them became and still are dear friends after many years. This experience is what I try to offer my guests. Live like a local, feel at home. Tot ziens in Amsterdam, Marcel.

B&B Lisenced by council of Amsterdam.

My name is Frans Wasmann and together with my girlfriend we live happily in Amsterdam. A few of my favorite destinations are Australia (I lived 6 months Down Under), Kenya and Latin America. A quick description of myself; family and friends (in that order) are two key aspects of my life I hold dear. For that reason I love spending time with them, especially accompanied with nice food and good wine. Aside from traveling, I love to sport (running and football mostly) and enjoy my work as a real estate developer.

Feel free to contact me should you wish to know more about me.

Kind regards,

Frans

I am Florie, 32, I am from a small town called Périgueux (Dordogne) in the South of France. Our region is famous for its wine, castels, caves and amazing food. I studied and lived in Bordeaux, London, La Rochelle, Montréal, Göteborg & Brussels. I live in Amsterdam for 5 years with my fiancé. I'm in love of this town!
I am working now in a SaaS company.
I love reading scandinavian books, planning my trips, cooking for friends, and relaxing at home. I like bathing parties, boating trips, picnics & BBQ, mountaineering, nature.
I enjoy yoga, fitness, paddle, walking, receiving my friends, dogs, arts, making comfort at home. 
Above all, I love traveling and meeting local people and just walking through streets I never heard of. It is funny getting lost in big cities, discovering foreign cultures and how the local people live.

Hobbies : modern art exhibitions, cultural events, art (architecture, photography, painting, sculptures, literature), jazz music, cooking and baking, Italian food and French bakery.

We are hard working film and television professionals. Before building this boat we used to travel a lot. Now every day feels like a holiday. When we are at home we'll be happy to welcome you and tell you everything you want to know about Amsterdam and the boat. But most of the time we're out working. It will make your stay more private.
