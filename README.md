# Airbnb House Price Prediction Project

## Introduction

Airbnb has revolutionized the travel industry, providing travelers with alternative accommodations and a unique way to experience destinations globally. This project aims to build a machine learning model capable of predicting Airbnb house prices based on various factors. The model will be useful for both hosts and guests:

- **Hosts**: Predict optimal pricing strategies to maximize revenue.
- **Guests**: Understand fair prices when booking accommodations.

## Data Understanding

- **Data Source**: House listings collected from Airbnb ([Link](https://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data))
- **Variables**:
  - Target Variable: Price
  - Features:
    - Location (neighborhood, city)
    - Number of rooms, bathrooms
    - Property type (apartment, house, etc.)
    - Amenities (pool, WiFi, etc.)
    - Host information (response rate, verifications)
    - Ratings and reviews

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

### Data Cleaning
- Handle missing values
- Remove outliers

### Descriptive Statistics
- Calculate means, medians, and standard deviations for numerical features.
- Analyze distributions using histograms and box plots.

### Correlation Analysis
- Visualize correlation matrix to identify relationships between features and the target variable.

## Feature Engineering

- **Categorical Encoding**: Transform categorical features into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding or label encoding.
- **Text Processing**: Extract valuable information from text fields (e.g., descriptions) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques.
- **Feature Creation**: Derive new features that might have a stronger influence on price, such as:
  - Distance to landmarks
  - Seasonal trends
  - Competition density

## Model Selection

- **Baselines**: Begin with simple models like linear regression.
- **Experimentation**: Explore various machine learning algorithms:
  - Tree-based models (Random Forest, XGBoost)
  - Support Vector Machines (SVMs)
  - Neural networks (if ample data is available)
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimize the hyperparameters of each algorithm using techniques like GridSearchCV or RandomizedSearchCV.

## Model Evaluation

- **Metrics**: Utilize regression metrics such as:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
  - Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
  - R-squared
- **Cross-Validation**: Use k-fold cross-validation to avoid overfitting and obtain a robust estimate of model performance.
